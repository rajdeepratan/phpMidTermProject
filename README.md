<h3 align="center">Description of the project</h3>

For this project, you have to invent a company name of your own and find a logo
for it. You also have to determine which kind of product this company will sell.
<br/><br/>
Then you have to create a small website to record all the orders made by customers.
This website project name should be your <span style="color: red">student number</span>.
<br/><br/>
All the files should use a common PHP functions .php file for common operations.
At the bottom of every page, there should be the following text:
<br/>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold" align="center">
Copyright your <span style="color: red">name</span> (your <span style="color: red">student number</span>) 2022
</h3>

<br/><br/>
Instead of typing 2022 you have to use the current year of the server current date,
so on january 1st 2023, the website will display, for example:

<h3 style="font-weight: bold" align="center">Copyright Bill Torvalds (1244556) 2023.</h3>
<br/><br/>
You must not use any style attribute directly in HTML tags. All the pages should 
make use of at least one <span style="font-weight: bold">.css file </span> and all the pages must have a background color. 
The design of your pages must not look too minimalistic.
